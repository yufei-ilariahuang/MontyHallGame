# Monty Hall Game Project

Welcome to our Monty Hall Game project repository! This interactive game is a digital simulation of the famous Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. Our version of the Monty Hall game offers users a chance to play the game themselves and explore the underlying probabilities. This project was created using React.js and is a collaborative effort by students from Northeastern University for the course 5002.

## Project Overview

The Monty Hall problem is a counter-intuitive probability puzzle with three doors, behind one of which is a prize. Participants choose a door, after which one of the remaining doors is opened, revealing no prize. Participants can then stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door. Our game simulates this scenario, allowing players to test the theory in practice.

### Features

- Interactive Monty Hall game simulation.
- Probability analysis to explore the mathematical principles behind the game.
- Comprehensive presentation and report detailing our findings and development process.

### Live Demo

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. To check, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```
2. Install NPM packages:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the local server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

After starting the server, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to play the game. Choose a door and decide whether to stick or switch after one door is revealed. Experiment with different strategies to see if you can uncover the winning strategy!

## Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort, developed as part of a team project for course 5002 at Northeastern University. Our team consisted of five members, and we worked together on the game development, probability analysis, and the creation of a presentation and report.
